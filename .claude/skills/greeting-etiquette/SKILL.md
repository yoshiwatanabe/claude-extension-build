## Purpose

## Core Greeting Principles

### Universal Guidelines

**Timing and Attention**
- Make eye contact when greeting (varies by culture)

- Observe cultural norms of the environment
- Match the energy level of the other person
- Be mindful of time constraints

### Formal Greetings

**Professional Settings**
Use formal greetings in business contexts, initial meetings, and when addressing authority figures:

**Key characteristics:**

### Casual Greetings

**Informal Settings**
Use casual greetings with friends, peers, and in relaxed environments:

- "What's up?" / "How's it going?"
- "Good to see you!"
- "How are you doing?"

**Key characteristics:**

## Situational Guidelines

6. Include a brief pleasantry

4. Show genuine interest
5. Be approachable and friendly

### Digital Greetings

**Email Greetings**
- Formal: "Dear [Name]," or "Hello [Name],"
- Casual: "Hi [Name]," or "Hey [Name],"
- Match the formality to the relationship and context
- Consider time zones when greeting

**Video Calls**
- Arrive on time (greeting happens at scheduled time)

- Use names when addressing people
- Be mindful of mute status

**Text Messages**
- "Hi," "Hey," or "Hello" appropriate
- Consider relationship when choosing greeting style
- Emoji use varies by age and culture
- Timing matters - avoid very early or late messages

## Special Considerations

### Addressing Groups

When greeting multiple people:
1. Acknowledge the group as a whole first
2. Then greet individuals if time permits
3. Pay respect to highest-ranking person first in formal settings
4. In casual settings, greet those nearest or closest relationships first
5. Use inclusive language ("Hello everyone," "Good morning, team")

### Returning Greetings

Always reciprocate greetings:
- Match the enthusiasm and formality
- Use the person's name if they used yours
- A brief response is sufficient ("Hello," "Good morning")
- Smile even if in a hurry
- If extremely busy, acknowledge and apologize: "Hi! Sorry, I'm in a rush, but good to see you!"

### Greeting Hierarchy

In formal or traditional settings:
1. Junior greets senior first
2. Lower rank greets higher rank first
3. Younger greets elder first
4. Guest waits for host to initiate in very formal settings

In casual settings:
- First person to see the other typically greets first
- No strict hierarchy
- Spontaneity is acceptable

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Cultural Missteps**
- Assuming all cultures value direct eye contact
- Using overly casual greetings in formal settings
- Inappropriate physical contact (hugging when handshake expected)
- Mispronouncing names without asking for correction
- Forgetting someone's name immediately after introduction

**Etiquette Errors**
- Not standing when appropriate
- Looking at phone during greeting
- Weak or overly aggressive handshakes
- Interrupting ongoing conversations to greet
- Not reciprocating greetings
- Overstaying the greeting (making it awkward)

**Digital Mistakes**
- Using all caps (appears as shouting)
- Overly casual in professional emails
- Not greeting at all (jumping straight to request)
- Excessive emoji in formal contexts
- Reply-all greetings in large groups

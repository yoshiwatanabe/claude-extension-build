# Color Theory

## Purpose

This skill provides fundamental knowledge about color theory, color mixing, harmonies, and practical applications. It includes a utility script for RGB color calculations, demonstrating how skills can bundle executable tools alongside knowledge.

## Core Color Concepts

### Primary Colors

**Additive (Light) - RGB**
- Red (255, 0, 0)
- Green (0, 255, 0)
- Blue (0, 0, 255)

Used in digital displays, screens, and light-based applications. When combined at full intensity, they create white light.

**Subtractive (Pigment) - RYB**
- Red
- Yellow
- Blue

Traditional artist's color wheel. When mixed, they theoretically create black (in practice, dark brown). Used for paint, ink, and physical pigments.

**Subtractive (Print) - CMYK**
- Cyan
- Magenta
- Yellow
- Key (Black)

Professional printing standard. Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow theoretically create black, but Key (black) is added for true blacks and to save ink.

### Secondary Colors

**RGB Additive System:**
- Red + Green = Yellow (255, 255, 0)
- Red + Blue = Magenta (255, 0, 255)
- Green + Blue = Cyan (0, 255, 255)

**RYB Subtractive System:**
- Red + Yellow = Orange
- Yellow + Blue = Green
- Blue + Red = Purple/Violet

### Tertiary Colors

Created by mixing primary and secondary colors:
- Red-Orange
- Yellow-Orange
- Yellow-Green
- Blue-Green
- Blue-Violet
- Red-Violet

## Color Properties

### Hue
The pure color itself (red, blue, green, etc.). Position on the color wheel.

### Saturation (Chroma)
Intensity or purity of a color:
- **High saturation**: Vivid, intense colors
- **Low saturation**: Muted, grayed-out colors
- **Zero saturation**: Pure gray

### Value (Brightness/Lightness)
How light or dark a color is:
- **High value**: Lighter, toward white (tints)
- **Low value**: Darker, toward black (shades)
- **Middle value**: Pure hue

### Tint, Tone, and Shade

**Tint**: Color + White (lighter version)
```
Pure Red → Pink (red tint)
```

**Shade**: Color + Black (darker version)
```
Pure Blue → Navy (blue shade)
```

**Tone**: Color + Gray (muted version)
```
Pure Green → Sage (green tone)
```

## Color Harmonies

### Complementary Colors
Colors opposite each other on the color wheel. Create high contrast and vibrancy:
- Red ↔ Green
- Blue ↔ Orange
- Yellow ↔ Purple

**Usage**: Headlines, call-to-action buttons, attention-grabbing designs

### Analogous Colors
Colors adjacent on the color wheel (typically 3 colors). Create harmony and unity:
- Red, Red-Orange, Orange
- Blue, Blue-Green, Green
- Yellow, Yellow-Green, Green

**Usage**: Backgrounds, cohesive designs, natural-looking palettes

### Triadic Colors
Three colors evenly spaced on the color wheel. Balanced and vibrant:
- Red, Yellow, Blue (primary triad)
- Orange, Green, Purple (secondary triad)

**Usage**: Playful designs, balanced variety, energetic compositions

### Split-Complementary
Base color plus two colors adjacent to its complement. Softer than complementary:
- Blue, Yellow-Orange, Red-Orange
- Red, Yellow-Green, Blue-Green

**Usage**: High contrast without tension, more nuanced than complementary

### Tetradic (Rectangle)
Two complementary pairs forming a rectangle on the color wheel:
- Red, Green, Blue, Orange

**Usage**: Rich, complex designs with careful balance needed

### Square
Four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel:
- Red, Yellow-Green, Blue, Red-Orange

**Usage**: Dynamic designs, needs one color as dominant

### Monochromatic
Variations of a single hue using different tints, shades, and tones:
- Light Blue, Medium Blue, Dark Blue, Navy

**Usage**: Elegant, cohesive, minimalist designs

## RGB Color Mixing

In digital/light-based systems (additive color):

### Mixing Rules
- Red + Green = Yellow
- Red + Blue = Magenta
- Green + Blue = Cyan
- Red + Green + Blue = White
- No light = Black (0, 0, 0)

### Partial Mixing Examples
```
(255, 0, 0) + (0, 255, 0) = (255, 255, 0)   # Red + Green = Yellow
(128, 0, 0) + (0, 128, 0) = (128, 128, 0)   # Dark Red + Dark Green = Olive
(255, 0, 0) + (0, 0, 255) = (255, 0, 255)   # Red + Blue = Magenta
```

### Using the Color Mixer Script

This skill includes a Python utility for RGB calculations. To use it:

```bash
python $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/color-theory/scripts/rgb_mixer.py --color1 255,0,0 --color2 0,255,0
```

**Output:**
```
Color 1: RGB(255, 0, 0) - #FF0000
Color 2: RGB(0, 255, 0) - #00FF00
Mixed (50/50): RGB(128, 128, 0) - #808000
```

**Options:**
- `--color1 R,G,B`: First color (required)
- `--color2 R,G,B`: Second color (required)
- `--ratio RATIO`: Mix ratio, e.g., 0.3 means 30% color1 + 70% color2 (default: 0.5)
- `--format FORMAT`: Output format: hex, rgb, or both (default: both)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Equal mix
python rgb_mixer.py --color1 255,0,0 --color2 0,0,255

# 70% red, 30% blue
python rgb_mixer.py --color1 255,0,0 --color2 0,0,255 --ratio 0.7

# Hex output only
python rgb_mixer.py --color1 255,128,0 --color2 0,128,255 --format hex
```

## Practical Applications

### Web Design
**Best practices:**
- Use 60-30-10 rule: 60% dominant color, 30% secondary, 10% accent
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for text)
- Test color schemes with colorblind simulators
- Consider cultural color associations

**Common palettes:**
- Professional: Blues and grays
- Energetic: Reds and oranges
- Natural: Greens and browns
- Luxury: Purple, gold, black

### Branding
- Primary brand color: Main identity
- Secondary colors: Support and variation
- Neutral colors: Backgrounds and text
- Accent color: Calls-to-action

### User Interface
- Background: Low saturation, neutral
- Text: High contrast with background
- Primary actions: High saturation, complementary to background
- Secondary actions: Lower saturation
- Errors: Red tones
- Success: Green tones
- Warnings: Yellow/orange tones
- Info: Blue tones

## Color Accessibility

### WCAG Contrast Requirements

**Normal Text (< 18pt or < 14pt bold):**
- Level AA: 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Level AAA: 7:1 contrast ratio minimum

**Large Text (≥ 18pt or ≥ 14pt bold):**
- Level AA: 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Level AAA: 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum

### Color Blindness Considerations

**Types:**
- Protanopia: Red-blind (1% of males)
- Deuteranopia: Green-blind (1% of males)
- Tritanopia: Blue-blind (very rare)
- Achromatopsia: Complete color blindness (extremely rare)

**Best practices:**
- Never use color alone to convey information
- Use patterns, icons, or labels alongside color
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Prefer blue-orange over red-green contrasts
- Ensure sufficient brightness contrast
